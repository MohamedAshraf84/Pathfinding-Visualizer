# Graph Algorithms Visualizer
---

An Android application designed to visualize different graph algorithms and maze generation algorithms on a 2D grid. This app serves as a handy tool for understanding various pathfinding and maze generation algorithms visually, helping users grasp their mechanics and efficiency.

## Features
### Graph Algorithms Visualization<br/>
* The app allows users to visualize popular graph algorithms such as
    - Depth-First Search
    - Breadth-First Search
    - Greedy best-first search (Manhattan distance as heuristic).
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm.
    - A* Algorithm (Manhattan distance as heuristic).<br/>


### Maze Generation Algorithms<br/>
* In addition to pathfinding algorithms, the app includes maze-generation algorithms such as
    - Recursive Backtracker.
    - Prim's Algorithm.
    - Basic random.

### Interactive Grid Interface<br/>
* Users can interact with the grid by
    - Defining start and end points.
    - Placing obstacles.
    - Placing random weights.<br/>


### User Interaction<br/>
* The user can do the following:
    - Pressing the visualize button to start the visualization after choosing an algorithm.
    - Choose a maze-generation algorithm to generate a maze.
    - Clear the grid entirely with the 'Clear' button or clear the path using 'Clear Path'.
    - Resize the grid size.
    - Adjust the visualization speed.

### Future updates
* Updating Path in Real Time: implement functionality to update the path dynamically when the user moves the start or end node to another location on the grid.
* Adding more algorithms: expand the selection of algorithms available for visualization. Introduce additional graph algorithms and maze generation algorithms.
* Enhancing animation: enhance the visual animation to achieve a more impressive effect.
